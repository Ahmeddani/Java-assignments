# Twitter Bootstrap Exercise

For this exercise, you will need to create a responsive site using the Twitter Bootstrap framework. The following are things that you might want to keep in mind as you approach this exercise:

* You will need to include references to the following:
    * **Bootstrap 3.3 (CSS)** - This will be used for the foundational CSS that is used by the site. See the [documentation][bootstrap-getting-started] for more information on loading the library in your page.
    * **jQuery** - Bootstrap's JavaScript components are dependent upon jQuery. That being said, you will need to include a reference to the jQuery library in order for these components to function properly. There are some additional notes in the "Plugin dependencies" section of the [documentation][bootstrap-javascript].
    * **Bootstrap 3.3 (JS)** - This script file contains the necessary code for Bootstrap's JavaScript components to function as expected. See the [documentation][bootstrap-getting-started] for more information on loading the library in your page.
    * **Font Awesome** - The icons that are displayed in the site make use of a CSS font library called "Font Awesome". This library includes over 4,000 CSS icons you can include in your projects. To include the library, see the [documentation][font-awesome-getting-started].
* Because the site is responsive, you will need to make sure that you are including the appropriate meta tags in your HTML file. For more information, see the [documentation][bootstrap-basic-template].
* Need help finding the appropriate Font Awesome icon? Try using the [search][font-awesome-icon-gallery] functionality on the Font Awesome site.
* Sizing of your icons not what you expect? Font Awesome provides the ability for you to [specify icon sizes][font-awesome-icon-sizing].
* Keep in mind, there is a difference between `container-fluid` and `container`.
* While Bootstrap contains most of the code you will need in order to work through the exercises, you may also need to include your own CSS styles. This will often be a common need on sites you create. That being said, you will probably need to create an external CSS stylesheet for your project. **HINT: There is a commented out `link` tag that refers to a CSS stylesheet already in the HTML file.**
* Because Bootstrap is a popular framework for building websites, there are a large number of examples that already exist on the web for most use cases. Try solving the problems on your own, but don't be afraid to also learn ~~steal~~ from others. If you do happen to find something that is already built, take the time to at least understand what that code is doing. Why did the author make the decisions they did when they wrote it? What could they have done differently? What can you do to make that code more efficient or better overall? Ask yourself, "What can I learn from this example?"
* Although you will be using JavaScript components available in Bootstrap, you should not need to create your own JS files.
* You probably won't need the respond.js library at this point. See the Respond.js [documentation][respond-js-documentation] for more details about what this library is, and how people use it.
